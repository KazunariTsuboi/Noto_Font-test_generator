# Font-test-generator
This tool is designed to help in generating HTML test cases for fonts using text or Unicode hex digits. Tool will create a test case with all font styles available for the script selected. We focused on having this tool able to work independently on desktop and on mobile devices without any type of installation. 

Why do we need this tool?
Consistent test cases
Reduce the time to create test cases by up to 95%
Helps in comparing multiple fonts without unwanted fonts interference
Use the correct language code
Render RTL/LTR locales

Please note the tool uses Blank font as a fallback font to ensure there are no unwanted fonts involved in the rendering. This fallback font and any local fonts used in the test should be in the same directory where the test case is created.
